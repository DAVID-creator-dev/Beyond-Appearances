# Beyond Appearances 

**Beyond Appearances** is a point-and-click puzzle game created during **ISART DIGITAL’s Game Week** in collaboration with **Women in Games France**. The game challenges stereotypes by having players return lost items to their rightful owners in the subway — but nothing is as simple as it seems. Make the wrong choices, and the game ends.
